# Health Metrics Organizer: BMI & MAP Calculator

## Background
The  Health Metrics Organizer: BMI & MAP Calculator Program was created to address health issues like hypertension and obesity, which remain significant concerns in Indonesia. Based on Riskesdas 2013 data, hypertension prevalence is 25.8%, and obesity among children aged 5-12 years is 18.8%. Shifting dietary patterns, including increased consumption of high-salt, high-fat, and low-fiber processed foods, contribute to these conditions. Despite government initiatives such as school health programs and community health monitoring, results have been inadequate. This program aims to help users monitor their health metrics effectively.

## Objectives
The program provides a platform for users to:
1. **Health Data Recording**: Users can input weight, height, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure. Data is saved for future access unless the program is force-closed.
2. **MAP Calculation**: Computes MAP using blood pressure inputs and categorizes results.
3. **BMI Calculation**: Calculates BMI using user inputs and classifies it according to health standards.

## Limitations
BMI is not a comprehensive metric for obesity assessment, limiting the programâ€™s accuracy in evaluating obesity levels.

## Recommendations
Future iterations of this program could incorporate additional metrics for obesity detection, increasing its accuracy and applicability.
